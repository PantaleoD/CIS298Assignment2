## Description
Temperature Converting program

Create a temperature converter application.                                                                 done
The application should look like the screen shots I have provided.                                          pretty close!
The application should do the calculation and display the formula that was used to do the calculation.      done
The calculation of the conversion should take place in a separate class                                     done
The application should handle errors gracefully.                                                            done
The application should have a different layout for landscape form that looks like the one pictured here.    done
The application must retain it's information on the screen when rotated to landscape.                       done

Solution Requirements:

* Separate class for calculation -                    done
* Handle errors gracefully                            done
* Separate Layout for landscape                       done
* Retain information across rotation                  done

### Notes

The book does not cover how to do work with Radio Buttons. I will talk about it as needed in class. If you are stuck or have questions about it, ask.

## Outside Resources Used
I used the programs done in class primarily and stack overflow and talked with you and Rob
   who suggested a return...which reminded me to create a class variable in Java...and use 
   the property from the Calculation class....which is so how I teach it in C#

   Marty helped me with layout and degree symbol and listened to my ideas and complaints :)

## Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program

   looks like they are all fixed now!

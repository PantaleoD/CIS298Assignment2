Create a temperature converter application.
The application should look like the screen shots I have provided.
The application should do the calculation and display the formula that was used to do the calculation.
The calculation of the conversion should take place in a seperate class
The application should handle errors gracefully.
The application should have a different layout for landscape form that looks like the one pictured here.
The application must retain it's information on the screen when rotated to lanscape.

Solution Requirements:

### Notes

The book does not cover how to do work with Radio Buttons. I will talk about it as needed in class. If you are stuck or have questions about it, ask.

## Outside Resources Used
I used the programs done in class primarily and stack overflow and talked with you and Rob
   who suggested a return...which reminded me to create a class variable in Java...and use 
   the property from the Calculation class....which is so how I teach it in C# 

## Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program

good question....
